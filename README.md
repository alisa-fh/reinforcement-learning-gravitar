# Reinforcement learning agent playing Gravitar

For this project I have developed further a basic Advantage Actor Critic reinforcement learning agent model (A2C) in Python to play the infamously hard Atari game, Gravitar.

If it means anything... it played better than I did.
See the [Google Colab](<./A2C_Atari.ipynb>) file for the code.

Download the video [here](./openaigym.video.0.4017.video000380-950.mp4) for the agent's best performance.
